# Our Story

Our team was formed in February 2020 when Niels Tangherlini, EMS Operations Chief with the SFFD, reached out to Code for SF to help solve a problem he’d encountered for many years:
**How to help ambulances direct non-critical patients to EDs with the most availability.**

Since then, we’ve worked closely with the SFFD, and nurses, administrators, and etc. from local hospitals to develop an xyz.

Today, we’re beta testing an MVP of the platform in San Francisco.
