# Our Story

Our team was formed in February 2020 when Niels Tangherlini, EMS Operations Chief with the SFFD, reached out to Code for SF to help solve a problem he’d encountered for many years: how to help ambulances direct non-critical patients to EDs with the most availability.

Since then, we’ve worked closely with the SFFD, as well as nurses, administrators, and IT departments from local hospitals to develop an working prototype of the platform.

Today, we’re preparing to beta test the tool in the city of San Francisco.
